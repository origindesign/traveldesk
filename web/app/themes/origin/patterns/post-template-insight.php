			<p>Turtle Bay Resorts was one such client whose 2023 leisure campaign aimed to build and maintain brand awareness across a selection of audience personas, while promoting Hawaii as an incredibly rich and varied destination for US travellers. The campaign generated website engagements, inquiries, bookings, and revenue through a combination of targeting tactics and beautiful digital assets which aimed to showcase the incredible History &amp; Culture of Hawaii. It was important that the marketing be positioned to sell the destination, as much as the property itself.</p>

			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p>The target audiences included ‘Luxury Nomads’, ‘Young Families’, ‘Active Families’, ‘Roaming Romantics’, ‘Laidback Locals’ and ‘Wave Followers’ but the challenge was to ensure targeting maintained a healthy balance between influencing and inspiring new audiences to travel to Hawaii, while also identifying and converting audiences who were already showing signals of intent for travel to Hawaii or stays at competitor 5-star hotels.</p>

			<p>In addition to activating trivago search data, CRM data was activated via The Trade Desk’s UID2 - matching and scaling highly relevant audiences who had already stayed at Turtle Bay Resorts and who might want to return.</p>

			<p>This campaign exceeded expectations, delivering an ROAS of 12:1, over 20,000 inquiries and over 100 bookings. Audience targeting powered by trivago data drove more engagements than all the other prospecting audiences combined, and the CRM activation using UID2 drove a considerable number of inquiries and engagements too.</p>
